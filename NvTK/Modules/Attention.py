    About
    -----
    Attention is used to focus processing on a particular region of input.
    This function implements the most common attention mechanism [1, 2, 3],
    which produces an output by taking a weighted combination of value vectors
    with weights from by a scoring function operating over pairs of query and
    context vectors.
    Given query vector `q`, context vectors `c_1,...,c_n`, and value vectors
    `v_1,...,v_n` the attention score of `q` with `c_i` is given by
        s_i = f(q, c_i)
    Frequently, `f` is given by the dot product between query and context vectors.
        s_i = q^T c_i
    The scores are passed through a normalization functions g.
    This is normally the softmax function.
        w_i = g(s_1,...,s_n)_i
    Finally, the output is computed as a weighted
    combination of the values with the normalized scores.
        z = sum_{i=1}^n w_i * v_i
    In many applications [4, 5] the context and value vectors are the same, `v_i = c_i`.
    Sizes
    -----
    This function accepts batches of size `B` containing
    `M` query vectors of dimension `D1`,
    `N` context vectors of dimension `D2`, 
    and optionally `N` value vectors of dimension `P`.
    Variable Length Contexts
    ------------------------    
    If the number of context vectors varies within a batch, a context
    can be ignored by forcing the corresponding weight to be zero.
    In the case of the softmax, this can be achieved by adding negative
    infinity to the corresponding score before normalization.
    Similarly, for elementwise normalization functions the weights can
    be multiplied by an appropriate {0,1} mask after normalization.
    To facilitate the above behavior, a context mask, with entries
    in `{-inf, 0}` or `{0, 1}` depending on the normalization function,
    can be passed to this function. The masks should have size `(B, M, N)`.
    Alternatively, a list can be passed giving the size of the context for
    each item in the batch. Appropriate masks will be created from these lists.
    Note that the size of output does not depend on the number of context vectors.
    Because of this, context positions are truly unaccounted for in the output.
