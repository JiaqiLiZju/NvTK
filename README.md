# NvTK

code used for ```Systematic evaluation of deep learning predicting expression at single-cell level```

NvTK (NvwaToolKit), a systemmatic and easy-using deep learning software in genomics. It support modern deep learning achitectures in genomics, such as ResNet, Attention Module, and Transformer. 

Nvwa, a deep learningâ€“based strategy, to predict expression landscapes and decipher regulatory elements (Filters) at the single-cell level. See our previous work in https://github.com/JiaqiLiZju/Nvwa
